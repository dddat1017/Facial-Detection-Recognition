    "1. __OpenCV__ - *Open Source Computer Vision Library, is an open source computer vision and machine learning software library ... The library has more than 2500 optimized algorithms ... These algorithms can be used to detect and recognize faces, identify objects, classify human actions in videos, track camera movements, track moving objects, etc.* - opencv.org\n",
    "2. __Numpy__ - *NumPy, is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python ... NumPy can also be used as an efficient multi-dimensional container of generic data.* - numpy.org\n",
    "3. __OS__ - *OS, is a built-in module from Python. The functions OS provides, allows for interfacing with the underlying operating system Python is running on (e.g. Mac, Windows, Linux).*\n",
    "4. __PIL & Image__ - *Python Imaging Library (PIL) adds support for opening, manipulating, and saving many different image file formats. Image is a Module within the Library.*\n",
    "5. __Pickle__ - *Pickle converts Python objects (object from a class, variable, list, etc.) to byte stream and then back again. With Machine Learning, saving Classifier.*"
